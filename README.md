# Group Selector

The group selector is a silly little project I like to create whenever I am learning either a new language or framework. The project provides a simple screen where you can load up a list of friends and randomly select groups of whatever size you would like out of the pool of friends.

This project was made to understand the basics of vuejs and tailwind.

## Running the project

To run the project use command from the root project directory:

    npm run dev

You can then access the page at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
